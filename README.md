# Socket IO Live Chat

This project aims to test Socket.IO by creating a real-time chat application. It utilizes several modern technologies to ensure a smooth development experience:

- **pnpm** as the package manager
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Node.js** for the backend
- **Vite** as the bundler

## Development Setup

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies** using pnpm:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite) to view the application.
